# AniSekai-Bot
Discord Bot for AniSekai Discord Server

Before doing anything else i suggest you learn js/Node.js basics so you can make your own commands or atleast debug, As some commands HAVE FLOWS. make sure to create a application
and Bot on Discord Dev Portal.

Usage:
- download & extract file.
- install node js.
- go to the extracted folder and install discord.js: `npm install discord.js`
- make a file named ".env"(without any extension!), and write `BOT_TOKEN: you_bot_token_here`.
- open cmd in the bot directory and run command: `node index.js`.
- if it shows "Ready!" bot is running.

I might be making changes to commands which are specific for some server or user, and it might give you error or doesn't work, you can ask me about it or any other questions on,
Discord: rA9#0932 or Twitter: `__r_A_9__` (`https://twitter.com/__r_A_9__`).
